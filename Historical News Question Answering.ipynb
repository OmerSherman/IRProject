It is neither pretentious nor bold to say, that It is only a question of time when Russia shall become the mistress of the city of Constantinople.

There is only one.\",\n          \"They said they pitied us, honored our efforts, and condemned the conduct of Austria; but they could not help us, because Europe required a powerful Austrian empire, and they must support it, in spite of its evils, as a balance against Russia in central and eastern Europe. What a mistake! What diplomacy! Is it not as clear as the sun that the Czar, in aiding Austria, would do it in such a manner as to obtain the greatest advantages for himself? Was it not manifest that Austria\\u2014who had always, through the help of Hungary, strength enough to oppose Russia\\u2014would, when she declared Hungary by Russian bayonets, no longer be an independent power, but merely the avant-garde of the Muscovite? Yet Europe permitted the invasion! It is an indelible mark of blindness and shame. It is ever thus in the imbecile Old World. They treated us just as they treat Turkey. They assert always that the peace of Europe and the balance of power require the preservation of the Turkish empire\\u2014that Turkey must exist, to check the advance of the Cossack power. But, notwithstanding this, England and France destroyed the Turkish fleet at Navarino\\u2014a fleet which never could have injured them, but which might have contended with Russia in the Black Sea. Always the same worn-out old, and fatal system of policy! While Russia, ever alert, seizes province after province from Turkey.\",\n          \"In the south it has almost accomplished its triumph; and we behold, almost daily, the mighty heavings of its efforts to obtain dominion in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and portions of the Austrian empire. In the north, although existing, and even at work, it is repressed and kept down by the as yet superior force of conservatism in its extreme of principle and power\\u2014that is, in the form of despotism. In this view the South of Europe, namely, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austrian Italy, and some parts of Germany, is standing in the attitude of contrast, and of moral though not physical hostility, to Russia, Prussia, and Austria proper; and France, the greatest power in Europe except England, stands in the gap between and has danger to apprehend from both parties to the fearful contest which, but for her, would speedily begin. She is by position the negative mediating power that as yet maintains the peace of Europe: for who can doubt that if France were all republican, as after the Revolution, republicanism would be up in arms for active warfare against the northern powers, throughout all the South of Europe, or that if France were ready to join the northern powers, they would make haste to crush the spirit of republicanism in the south?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
