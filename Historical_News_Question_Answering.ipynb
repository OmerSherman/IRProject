The date of the letter, which was denied in court a few days since by the Managers, was today admitted in the House, but innocent motives asserted; Logan's speech was very bitter. Butler then took the floor and accused Brooks of robbing his partners. He asked Brooks if, while he (Butler) was fighting, he did not in this House call him (Butler) a gold robber.

That there had seldom or never been more than 3,000,000 at any one time in all the banks of the city. That upon a division of the $80,000,000 of specie in the United States among the 16,000,000 inhabitants, there would fall to the share of each individual the sum of $5, which, again divided by the 365 days of the year, would give each person less than 2 cents per day.

It can therefore be easily taken off for repairs or any other purpose, at pleasure. The standard is also 2 inches higher, and cast with the same circle as the mouldboard until it enters the beam.
